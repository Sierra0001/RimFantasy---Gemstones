# RimFantasy - Gemstones

This mod adds 11 new gemstones, as well as the worktables (requires research) needed to craft the uncut gems into cut gems.

Raw gemstones can be used to craft stuffable furniture and blunt weapons the same way jade works in vanilla. The cut gemstones worth more than their uncut variants and are used in trading and creation of certain ceremonial objects.

### Balance

Gems are intentionally sparse and not easy to obtain through natural means, but can be obtained through trades and from salvaging certain objects.

### Features

- 11 Gem Stones (Rough/Cut)
- 2 Worktables (Unpowered/Powered)
- 2 Researches (Unlocks Worktables)

- Save Game Compatible
