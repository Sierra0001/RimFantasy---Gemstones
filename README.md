# RimFantasy - Gemstones

This mod adds 11 new minable gemstones, as well as the worktables (requires research) needed to craft the uncut gems into cut gems.

Raw gemstones can be used to craft stuffable furniture and blunt weapons the same way jade works in vanilla. The cut gemstones worth more than their uncut variants and are used in trading and creation of certain ceremonial objects.

### Features

- 11 Gemstones (x11 Rough/x11 Cut)
- 2 Workbenches (Medieval/Industrial)
- 2 Researches (Unlocks Workbenches)

### Balance

Gems are intentionally sparse and not easy to obtain through natural means, but they can also be purchased from traders or obtained from salvaging certain objects.

Balance feedbacks are welcomed, please provide context when doing so.

### Compatibility

- Save Game Compatible
- Will not play nice with other gemstone mods without a patch.
